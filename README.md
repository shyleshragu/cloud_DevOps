# Cloud DevOps

## Introduction

This repository contains the architectural diagrams for deploying [Trading Application](https://github.com/shyleshragun/trading_app) onto cloud server. The application was deployed onto AWS Elastic Beanstalk which assisted the developers in deploying and managing applications in the AWS Cloud. A zip file generated by Maven was used as the *application code* in EB AWS. The EB was used to create a ***Dev*** environment for the application. CloudFormation was used to provision the application infrastructures. Then, a ***Prod*** environment was created using AWS console in the EB application.
